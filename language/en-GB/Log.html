<p>You can log some messages in a log file named <code>plg_system_hyphenateghsvs-log.csv</code> inside the log directory of Joomla. Click on button <code>Show Log File Path and Size</code> if you don't know the folder.</p>
<p>Logging happens in front-end of Joomla.</p>
<p>If you have activated <code>Cleanup</code> it will log more (if issues are found) including links to pages where an issue was found. The latter is the reason why I've added the Log feature. Combined with log features of Hyphenopoly you can debug then the found links more specific.</p>
<p>Be aware that showing of very large files with button <code>Show Log File Content</code> can take ages. Be patient after clicking on the button!</p>
<p>Delete the file if it becomes too large also because of performance reasons concerning the Log feature.</p>
<p>Dactivate <code>Log</code> if you're debug work is done.</p>
