<p><b>Be aware:</b> I cannot guarantee that the <code>Cleanup</code> feature will lead to a more performant page in any circumstance. <b>Therefore I mark this setting "experimental"</b>.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a multilingual Joomla site (<code>de-de</code> and <code>en-gb</code>) with a language switcher. Because Hyphonopoly doesn't check if the languages that you've configured for all of your pages are really needed by the displayed page you will see error/warning/info messages in the browser console, e.g. for the german page: <code>engine for language 'en-gb' loaded, but no elements found.</code> (= <i>I couldn't find a <code>lang=en-gb</code> in current HTML code</i>).</p>
<p>Even if these messages are unproblematic and can help you a lot to configure the plugin correctly it's impossible to get rid of them by correct language configuration for a multilingual site.</p>
<p>Hyphenopoly won't stop working but it's a performance issue when Hyphenopoly loads too much not needed language patterns.</p>
<p>If you activate <code>Cleanup</code> the plugin tries to remove unneccessary languages from the Hyphenopoly configuration script before loading it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Option YES: If <code>Cleanup</code> detects that none of the configured languages are needed on a page it will leave everything unchanged (= like configured by you) to give you a chance to debug the errors with console messages of Hyphenopoly.</li>
	<li>If you select option <code>FORCE</code> the cleanup will remove the whole configuration script <u>in that case</u> which means Hyphenopoly scripts won't be loaded. That means also: No console messages of Hyphenopoly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scripts that set the <code>hyphenate</code> and <code>donthyphenate</code> classes stay always untouched.</p>
